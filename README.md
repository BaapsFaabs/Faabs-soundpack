# Faabs-soundpack for Lethal company
This mod replaces some of the stock in game sounds with newer ones to "enhance" the experience. This mod is not meant for anyone but me and my friends, I'm only uploading it to thunderforge for ease of installation

## Installation
1.) Installation via thunderforge

If you have no experience in adding mods manually, this is recommended. This mod is client-side so all players need to have this installed for everyone to hear the same things.

2.) Installing manually

Navigate to the lethal company file in the thunderforge folder (somewhere in %appdata%). In the bepinex folder you will find the plugins tab. you'll want create a folder called CustomSounds. In there put the sounds you want (.wav/.mp3/.ogg) with the filename of the sound you want to replace.

A repository of Lethal Company sounds and their associated name can be found on this website: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/lethal-company-version-40-ambience-music-windows-gamerip-2023


## Dependencies
Bepinex is standard for most mods.
This mod also relies on the LCSoundtool mod by no00ob and customsounds by Clementinise.
